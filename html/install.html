					<p>This form allows you to create an initial administrator account.  This account is required in order to log into mgm and create regions, and approve users who apply for accounts using the registration page.  This form will only appear when you have no users.</p>
					<p>This avatar is the first on a new grid, so there is no gender, there are no templates, you will be a cloud on login.  You do not have an initial location or last location set.</p>
					<p>It is expected that you will use this account to create the necessary templates and bootstrap your grid.  After that, this account can be used as a normal Grid God account.</p>
